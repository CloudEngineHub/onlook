# The Ultimate

# UX Glossary

Learn all of the terms the pros in the field use to talk about what the nitty-gritty of the craft. Master these and you'll be the life of the next UX-happy hour at some dingey brewery with too many sours on tap.

## A/B Testing

Imagine you're a chef trying two different recipes for chocolate cake to see which one makes your dinner guests ask for seconds. A/B testing is just that, but for websites. You bake two versions of a page and serve them up to see which one has visitors coming back for more.

"After A/B testing, we discovered users prefer the website version that doesn't play 'Happy Birthday' on loop. Go figure."

## Accessibility

It's like throwing a party and making sure everyone, including your friend who only communicates through interpretive dance, can get in and enjoy themselves. Accessibility ensures your digital shindig is a hit with everyone, no velvet ropes or bouncers in sight.

"We ramped up our site's accessibility so much, even your grandma who still uses a rotary phone could RSVP."

## Affordance

This is when a door looks so much like it needs pushing, it practically pushes itself. In the digital world, affordance is making buttons and links scream, "Click me!" because nobody likes when a website is confusing.

"We made our 'Submit' button so obvious in its affordance, our inboxes are overflowing with complements."

## Anthropometrics

This is the science of measuring people's body parts, not for some weird Frankenstein project, but to make sure stuff like chairs, keyboards, and phones don't feel like they're designed for wet alien tentacles instead of human hands.

"Armed with anthropometrics, we designed a smartphone that actually fits in your pocket, unless you're wearing skinny jeans."

## Behavioral Economics

Picture trying to understand why people buy 17 packs of toilet paper when they hear the word 'snow'. Behavioral economics digs into the wacky world of why we do what we do with our money, especially when it makes zero sense.

"By applying behavioral economics, we figured out why users would rather collect virtual coins than save actual money."

## Cognitive Load

This is your brain on information overload, like trying to remember all your internet passwords at once. Cognitive load is about not turning users' brains into scrambled eggs by making websites as easy to digest as a mango smoothie. Unless you're alergic to mangoes...

"We reduced the cognitive load so much, browsing our site now feels like floating on a cloud made of puppies."

## It's time for a change. Or two or three.

## Content Strategy

That's your plan for not letting your website turn into a digital dumpster fire of random thoughts. Content strategy is like being the wise old librarian who knows exactly where every book should go, so readers always find the treasure they seek. My other cofounders delegated the content strategy to me and look at how far it's gotten us. Like it or not, you're experiencing the content strategy right now! AHHHH!

"Our content strategy is so on point, finding information on our site is easier than finding Waldo in a one-person lineup."

## Contextual Inquiry

This is like being a digital detective, following users around in their natural habitat to see why, when, and how they use your app to order pizza at 2 AM. It's all about understanding the wild behaviors in their tech jungle.

"After some contextual inquiry, we learned that our app is most popular with night owls who have a craving for pepperoni."

## Cross-Platform Design

Crafting a digital experience that feels like your favorite comfy couch, whether you're chilling on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop. Cross-platform design ensures you get the same warm fuzzies from your tech, no matter the screen size.

"Thanks to cross-platform design, using our app is like wearing your favorite hoodie; comforting, familiar, and fits just right, big screen or small."

## Dark Pattern

It's like your website playing dirty tricks to make users accidentally sign up for a lifetime supply of llama facts. Dark patterns are the digital equivalent of "no backsies" but in a way that makes everyone mad. It's generally frowned upon to practice dark pattern design in products.

"We cleared out the dark patterns, so now the only way you'll get llama facts is if you genuinely want to become a llama expert."

## Ecological Validity

This is making sure that what you observe in your fancy lab tests actually happens in the wild, like confirming that people do use their smartphones in the shower, and it's not just a weird rumor. Ecological validity keeps your findings as real as the pain of your last breakup.

"We aimed for ecological validity, and yep, turns out folks really do tweet from the tub."

## Fitts's Law

It's the idea that the bigger and closer something is, the easier it is to whack it with your mouse. Basically, it explains why you never miss the "Buy Now" button but always struggle with those tiny 'X' icons to close ads.

"According to Fitts's Law, we made our 'Submit' button so big and close, you could hit it with your elbow by accident."

## Gamification

This is when websites turn everything into a game, where shopping earns you points, and you level up by reviewing products. It's like turning life into a video game, but the only dragons you're slaying are in the form of completing your profile. Kind of sad if you think about it... anyways, we'll give you some fake internet points if you read all the way through the whole glossary. They're brand new internet points too... you'll love 'em!

"We gamified our app so hard, users now ask if defeating their shopping list will finally free the princess. To that we say – 'Corporate won't let us!' and carry on with our day."

## Gestalt Principles

These are brain tricks that make us see a dolphin in a sea of dots or a happy face in a car's front. They're about making users see what you want them to see on your site, without having to connect the dots for them.

"Thanks to the Gestalt Principles, visitors to our site immediately see the 'Buy' button as a beacon of hope in a chaotic world."

## Heuristic Evaluation

It's like having your website go through a reality TV makeover, with judges pointing out every flaw, from broken links to confusing layouts, all so it can emerge as a swan that users will love at first sight.

"After our heuristic evaluation, our website went from 'What is this?' to 'This is it!'"

## Hick's Law

The more choices you offer, the longer it takes for someone to make a decision. Hick's Law explains why it's easier to choose your ice cream flavor at home than at the store with 50 options. It's about keeping it simple so users don't freeze up like a deer in digital headlights.

"By applying Hick's Law, we trimmed down our menu from a novel to a pamphlet, and now people can actually decide what they want before the next ice age."

## Human Factors Engineering

This is the art of designing things so that humans don't need an engineering degree to use them. It's about acknowledging that people are perfectly imperfect and making sure they don't have to sprout extra limbs to use your product.

"Thanks to human factors engineering, our coffee machine no longer requires an advanced degree and a ritual dance to produce a latte."

## Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

This is studying how humans and computers can best get along, like a digital couples therapy. HCI works on smoothing out the rough patches so that interacting with technology feels less like a struggle and more like a partnership.

"After diving into HCI, we realized our software was the equivalent of leaving the toilet seat up in the relationship, and we promptly fixed that."

## Human Factors Engineering

This is the art of designing things so that humans don't need an engineering degree to use them. It's about acknowledging that people are perfectly imperfect and making sure they don't have to sprout extra limbs to use your product.

"Thanks to human factors engineering, our coffee machine no longer requires an advanced degree and a ritual dance to produce a latte."

## Inclusive Design

It's like throwing a party and making sure there's something for everyone, from your vegan cousin to your friend who only listens to Norwegian death metal. Inclusive design means everyone's invited and feels welcome, no matter their quirks or abilities.

"Our approach to inclusive design means our app is as friendly to left-handers as it is to those who've never used a smartphone without adult supervision."

## Information Architecture (IA)

Imagine you're the librarian of the internet, and instead of books, you're organizing webpages. IA is like deciding whether the cat videos go next to the gourmet cooking tutorials or in a completely different section. It's making sure when someone asks, "Where's the good stuff?" you don't just shrug but point them exactly where they need to go.

"We whipped our site's Information Architecture into shape; finding things is now as easy as pie, which, by the way, is under 'Desserts', not 'Pi'."

## Information Scent

This is the digital version of following the smell of baking cookies to find the kitchen. Information scent helps users sniff out the path to the content they're craving, without getting lost in the weeds of irrelevant links.

"We improved the information scent so well, users can now find our hidden easter eggs without a map or a sniffer dog."

## Service Blueprinting

Imagine you're a detective with a magnifying glass, but instead of solving a murder mystery, you're diving into the thrilling world of organizational processes. Yes, we're talking about drawing a map that shows who does what, when, and how in your business, so you can figure out why calling customer service feels like being in a maze without cheese.

"Service blueprinting was like our organizational GPS, helping us find and fix the roadblocks in our customer support highway."

## Touchpoint

Think of touchpoints as every high-five, fist bump, or awkward elbow touch you share with your customers. It's every time they stumble upon your brand, whether they're browsing your website at 2 AM or accidentally liking your tweet from 2014. You want each of these moments to feel like getting a warm, fuzzy hug, not a cold, wet fish handshake.

"Scouring through every touchpoint, we jazzed up our brand encounters to transform customer sighs into high-fives."

## Usability

Usability is making sure your website doesn't feel like you're trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded. It's about creating a smooth ride, so users don't need a map, a compass, and a sherpa to find what they're looking for.

"We focused so hard on usability that my grandma called to say she ordered two pairs of sneakers without asking for help. Finally!"

## Usability Heuristic

This is basically your grandma's old wisdom but for designing stuff on the internet. Usability heuristics are like those rules she had, such as 'don't wear socks with sandals' or 'eat your greens', except it's about making apps and websites less of a puzzle and more of a walk in the park.

"We dusted off the old usability heuristics book to make sure using our design felt like sliding down a rainbow, not climbing a cactus."

## Voice User Interface (VUI)

Ever wanted to talk to your gadgets and have them actually understand you, instead of beeping at you like a disappointed R2-D2? That's what Voice User Interfaces are for. They let you sweet-talk your devices into doing things for you, like finding the nearest taco stand or playing your favorite tunes without lifting a finger.

"Our newest app comes with a Voice User Interface, turning your ramblings into actions, making it almost as smart as your dog."

# The Ultimate

# UX Glossary

Learn all of the terms the pros in the field use to talk about what the nitty-gritty of the craft. Master these and you'll be the life of the next UX-happy hour at some dingey brewery with too many sours on tap.

## A/B Testing

Imagine you're a chef trying two different recipes for chocolate cake to see which one makes your dinner guests ask for seconds. A/B testing is just that, but for websites. You bake two versions of a page and serve them up to see which one has visitors coming back for more.

"After A/B testing, we discovered users prefer the website version that doesn't play 'Happy Birthday' on loop. Go figure."

## Accessibility

It's like throwing a party and making sure everyone, including your friend who only communicates through interpretive dance, can get in and enjoy themselves. Accessibility ensures your digital shindig is a hit with everyone, no velvet ropes or bouncers in sight.

"We ramped up our site's accessibility so much, even your grandma who still uses a rotary phone could RSVP."

## Affordance

This is when a door looks so much like it needs pushing, it practically pushes itself. In the digital world, affordance is making buttons and links scream, "Click me!" because nobody likes when a website is confusing.

"We made our 'Submit' button so obvious in its affordance, our inboxes are overflowing with complements."

## Anthropometrics

This is the science of measuring people's body parts, not for some weird Frankenstein project, but to make sure stuff like chairs, keyboards, and phones don't feel like they're designed for wet alien tentacles instead of human hands.

"Armed with anthropometrics, we designed a smartphone that actually fits in your pocket, unless you're wearing skinny jeans."

## Behavioral Economics

Picture trying to understand why people buy 17 packs of toilet paper when they hear the word 'snow'. Behavioral economics digs into the wacky world of why we do what we do with our money, especially when it makes zero sense.

"By applying behavioral economics, we figured out why users would rather collect virtual coins than save actual money."

## Cognitive Load

This is your brain on information overload, like trying to remember all your internet passwords at once. Cognitive load is about not turning users' brains into scrambled eggs by making websites as easy to digest as a mango smoothie. Unless you're alergic to mangoes...

"We reduced the cognitive load so much, browsing our site now feels like floating on a cloud made of puppies."

## It's time for a change. Or two or three.

# Using Onlook with your own projects

#### Let's make some beautiful web apps.

By Kiet •

Jul 28, 2024

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/B5nFEQkdyehe45cXtL40GqsWWs.jpg)

If you haven't already, we recommend visiting our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/onlook-dev/studio?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to learn how to get set up with Onlook.

## Code setup

To setup your NextJs codebase so Onlook can create pull requests (🔥) use the package manager of your choice and run:

```sp-c-fWymNx sp-pre-placeholder
npm i --save-dev @onlook/nextjs
```

then within your `next.config.mjs` or `next.config.js`, update swcPlugins to include `["@onlook/nextjs", { projectRoot: path.resolve(".") }]`

```sp-c-fWymNx sp-pre-placeholder
import path from "path";
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    swcPlugins: [\
      ["@onlook/nextjs", { projectRoot:path.resolve(".")}]\
    ],
  }
};
export default nextConfig;

```

**or alternatively,** you can view instructions for your framework below:

1. [React with Babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onlook/babel-plugin-react)

2. [React with Nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onlook/nextjs)


Now that your config is all set, either deploy to your hosting provider of choice or simply run the codebase locally. If you have any setup questions, lmk! You can email me whenever - [erik@onlook.dev](mailto:erik@onlook.dev).

Go to a website you want to edit. Ideally, this would be one you just setup, can set up later with a developer, or can get GitHub access to! You can also try it out on a website you're running locally.

If you're at a loss for inspiration, try our Demo Projects included in your Onlook Dashboard. They're already configured. To learn more about the Demo Projects, read [Creating your first Onlook Pull Request](https://onlook.com/blog/create-your-first-pull-request) like we told you too earlier. Sheesh.

## Creating a new project

Now that you are logged into the Extension and you are at the URL of a website you want to edit, open the Extension and create a "New Project" in the upper right corner.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/nZjqoWCsE5cQlm2FiDnAEzSBXQg.png)

Feel free to name it whatever you want, and don't worry about editing the URL. Then click "Start Editing" to make some changes!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/6yGoLU18f7rRMaHkJeUiRy3P8.png)

Now that you're in the editor you can click on anything on the webpage you want to edit, and it will open the Onlook editor.

Make some changes and once you're done, open the Extension and click the "Review" button.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QHTIOQM0nIbuEareOi2AADI.png)

This will take you to the dashboard where you will see your project and all the changes you just made. Now let's create a Pull Request.

## Creating your first Pull Request using Onlook

Let's turn your changes into code and create a Pull Request! Just click "Share" then "Pull Request"

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JjTk1Uh2Pi2LxGYRroT0gO63mGw.png)

This will open a modal where you'll want to add Onlook to the GitHub Repository associated with your edits.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/3MWXN1W2O6LiXIzEz6NT6ewbgs.png)

GitHub will ask you to select the Repository you want to use. Make sure it's all the same Repository.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/49DBAkpxf1H2mZUp7vyCClN3L0Y.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/u7faKgtv3BM1KwjkXAKSryZGE6M.png)

Once you're done, you will go back to your project where you can just click "Connect" on the Repository you setup.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3x6knrLl6u0wYZNqb2G5Elylgs.png)

Now just set the Branch you want to create a Pull Request from and the root directory of your code (usually this is the root folder and you can leave this alone).

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Y68AVyFjhlnvwUzJXDTfklsYLs.png)

Don't worry, you'll only have to do this setup once for the project.

Now that it's all set you can go to the publish tab, add an optional title and description to your changes and hit the "Publish" button!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/cD94uhP16pDVHunNp6ZO6cry8OI.png)

It will load for a few seconds depending on how many changes you made. Once it completes, you'll see a link to your first Pull Request with Onlook below!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/weAPmx3rUyDCmmdAyq0H2AVEkZY.png)

And that's it! You just created your first Pull Request with Onlook 🤘– that means real code on a real Repo.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/i17kXl5DXQ61jUB3EgaOxqVUFE.png)

If you're working with a team, ask an engineer or anyone else with GitHub access to review your Pull Request to get it merged in and keep shipping!! We really appreciate you checking out Onlook and hope this can make your workflow easier and more fun!

As always, if you have any questions or feedback let me know at kiet@onlook.dev.

## It's time for a change. Or two or three.

# What is a "Design Engineer"?

#### The hybrid species in the wilds of tech

By Daniel •

Mar 4, 2024

![A designer wearing a yellow jacket sitting in a moonlit forest with his Macbook Pro open.](https://framerusercontent.com/images/infPZaMVklrp6fD6fB0KDxwBgP4.png)

Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone who just accidentally clicked on this link while trying to find a meme, welcome to the mysterious world of tech titles. Today, we embark on a safari into the deepest, darkest corners of the software jungle to observe a rare creature that has recently begun to make its presence known: the "Design Engineer."

Now, for those of you who thought a Design Engineer was someone who meticulously engineers the patterns on your grandma's curtains—brace yourselves. This creature is far more complex, and, dare we say, revolutionary.

## What is a Design Engineer, Really?

Imagine, if you will, a unicorn. Not the kind that prances around rainbows but a mythical creature of the tech ecosystem that embodies the elusive blend of aesthetics and functionality. This unicorn, dear readers, is a designer who decided one day that merely designing wasn't enough. They wanted to conquer the mystical lands of code too.

Enter the Design Engineer: a designer who can write frontend code and contribute to a codebase. Yes, they are the Indiana Jones of the tech world, bridging the gap between the mystical arts of design and the logical realms of engineering. They're the folks who look at a beautifully designed interface and dare to say, "Yeah, I can make that work." Or at the very least, will wrestle with [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) long enough to figure out how.

## The Rise of the Design Engineer

Over the past year, this new role has started popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. Why, you ask? Because the world of software product design is damp and moist. No wait… Because the world of software design has realized something groundbreaking. It turns out, having someone who can both envision a stunning user interface and bring it to life through code is like having your cake and eating it too—except the cake is a website, and you're eating it with your eyes. Yum!

This evolution makes sense. In the old days (circa, oh, say 2010ish or so), designers would create their visionary concepts, then drop-kick them over the proverbial fence to developers, who would then try to interpret these designs into working code. It was a bit like playing a game of telephone in a noisy bar. By the time your message gets to the other side, "Please add a button here" has turned into "The bathroom is over there."

## The Skillset of a Design Engineer

But what does it take to be this mythical creature? First off, a Design Engineer must have an eye for design—not just any eye, but the kind that can spot the difference between #FFFFFF and #FEFEFE. They must possess the artistic prowess to craft interfaces that are not only functional but also beautiful, like a Renaissance painting, but for the digital age.

On the flip side, they need to be fluent in the languages of the web—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the latest frameworks. But not just fluent. We're talking "write poetry in React" level of fluency. Mostly because engineers are very specific about their craft, and anything short of Michelangelian perfection in code is often met with a grunt of disapproval.

## Why Design Engineers Are in Demand

Companies are on the hunt for these rare beings because they speed up the development process, enhance team collaboration, and ensure that the final product actually looks like the design it was supposed to be.

A lot of times the advantage of having a Design Engineer comes through by skipping the unnecessary step of drafting pictures of a User Interface (UI) before passing it off to someone else to code. Design Engineers bring their visual fundamentals to the frontend game, not only helping a company's product and brand look good, but also saving a ton of time from idea to implementation.

But becoming a Design Engineer is no easy task, and besides the obvious fact that mashing up both an engineer and a designer into one brain is a lot to ask of a brain, the few who identify as Design Engineers tend to be special exceptions. The role is mostly occupied by art kids who played a lot of video games and got too freaky with their [Winamp skins](https://skins.webamp.org/) back in middle school and it makes sense why – you gotta have the creative side and the engineering fearlessness to learn the ins-and-outs and complexities of code.

![Examples of Winamp skins that designers have made in the past](https://framerusercontent.com/images/kahEVT5Rq0Wuv7Kw4eXb9xsp1wY.png)

## The Future of the Design Engineer

So, what does the future hold for our Design Engineer friends? Will they become the new norm, or are they just a fleeting trend, like fidget spinners or eating Tide Pods?

The truth is, as our digital world becomes increasingly visual and interactive, the demand for professionals who can seamlessly blend design with development will only grow. The Design Engineer is not just a fad; they are the pioneers of a new frontier in tech, where the lines between design and engineering blur into one holistic role.

As we wrap up our safari through the tech jungle, let's take a moment to appreciate these majestic creatures, the Design Engineers, for their unique ability to bring together the best of both worlds. They are the proof that sometimes, you really can have it all—stunning designs that work flawlessly on the web.

So, the next time you come across a beautifully designed app that works like a charm, consider that there may have been a Design Engineer involved. They're the ones making sure our digital experiences are not just functional but also delightful to behold.

And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, you're a Design Engineer in the making. If you find yourself doodling interfaces on napkins and dreaming in CSS selectors, the call of the wild might just be for you. Or you may want to try out [Onlook](https://onlook.dev/) to learn more about how you can ship code without needing to reverse the clock to an earlier stage of life to pickup odd hobbies to expedite your development into an absolute master of the frontend.

Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games—and now, Design Engineers too.

# Inline vs. Internal vs. External CSS

#### What's the difference and does it matter?

By Daniel •

Apr 8, 2022

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CyFtPHMQ0RoMjB7Hi0hiZfyjVU.jpg)

In the wide, wild world of web design, where the brave souls who dare to venture into the abyss of code meet their fate, there lies a tale of three CSS musketeers: Inline, Internal, and External. These are not characters from a poorly written high school play, but rather, the very essence of what makes websites look less like a 1990s GeoCities page and more like the sleek, modern digital temples we worship today.

## Inline CSS: The Lone Ranger

First up, we have Inline CSS, the lone ranger of the bunch. Imagine you're getting dressed in the morning, but instead of putting on your clothes in a sensible manner, you tape each item directly to your skin. That's inline CSS. It's the practice of cramming style directly into your HTML elements, like attaching a tiny "style" suitcase to each tag as it passes by on the conveyor belt of your webpage.

Why would one do this, you ask? Well, sometimes you need that one paragraph to stand out because it's announcing something of earth-shattering importance, like the discovery that avocados have been misclassified as vegetables. In such cases, inline CSS is your quick and dirty friend. But use it sparingly, or you'll end up with a webpage that looks like it was dressed by a toddler in the dark.

## Internal CSS: The Homebody

Next, we have Internal CSS, the homebody of the group. This is when you decide to write all your styles at the top of your HTML document in a `<style>` tag. It's like keeping all your clothes in a chest at the foot of your bed. Convenient? Sure. Efficient? Debatable.

Internal CSS is great when you're making a one-page wonder or a love letter to your pet hamster, Mr. Snuffles, complete with color-coordinated sections detailing his many adventures. However, for larger sites, it's like trying to organize a wardrobe for the entire cast of "Game of Thrones" in a single closet. Chaos ensues.

## External CSS: The Social Butterfly

Lastly, we have External CSS, the social butterfly. This method involves creating a separate stylesheet file where you write all your styles, then link it to your HTML document. It's like having a personal stylist who outfits you based on the occasion; whether you're going to a black-tie event or to the grocery store, you're always appropriately dressed.

External CSS is the way to go for most websites. It keeps everything neat, organized, and easy to update. Want to change the color theme of your site from "depression chic" to "unicorn parade"? Just tweak a few lines in one file, and voilà, your site is now a beacon of joy and sparkles.

## Wrapping up

In the grand scheme of things, whether you choose Inline, Internal, or External CSS is like deciding between eating pizza with a fork and knife, scissors, or just diving in face-first. They all get the job done, but some methods are just more... refined than others.

So, as you venture forth into the tempestuous seas of web design, armed with your newfound knowledge of CSS styling, remember: the best method is the one that keeps you sane, your website looking sharp, and Mr. Snuffles' adventures in the limelight. Happy CSSing!

## It's time for a change. Or two or three.

# Using Onlook with your own projects

#### Let's make some beautiful web apps.

By Kiet •

2024/07/28

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/B5nFEQkdyehe45cXtL40GqsWWs.jpg)

If you haven't already, we recommend visiting our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/onlook-dev/studio?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to learn how to get set up with Onlook.

## Code setup

To setup your NextJs codebase so Onlook can create pull requests (🔥) use the package manager of your choice and run:

```sp-c-fWymNx sp-pre-placeholder
npm i --save-dev @onlook/nextjs
```

then within your `next.config.mjs` or `next.config.js`, update swcPlugins to include `["@onlook/nextjs", { projectRoot: path.resolve(".") }]`

```sp-c-fWymNx sp-pre-placeholder
import path from "path";
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    swcPlugins: [\
      ["@onlook/nextjs", { projectRoot:path.resolve(".")}]\
    ],
  }
};
export default nextConfig;

```

**or alternatively,** you can view instructions for your framework below:

1. [React with Babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onlook/babel-plugin-react)

2. [React with Nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onlook/nextjs)


Now that your config is all set, either deploy to your hosting provider of choice or simply run the codebase locally. If you have any setup questions, lmk! You can email me whenever - [erik@onlook.dev](mailto:erik@onlook.dev).

Go to a website you want to edit. Ideally, this would be one you just setup, can set up later with a developer, or can get GitHub access to! You can also try it out on a website you're running locally.

If you're at a loss for inspiration, try our Demo Projects included in your Onlook Dashboard. They're already configured. To learn more about the Demo Projects, read [Creating your first Onlook Pull Request](https://onlook.com/ja/blog/create-your-first-pull-request) like we told you too earlier. Sheesh.

## Creating a new project

Now that you are logged into the Extension and you are at the URL of a website you want to edit, open the Extension and create a "New Project" in the upper right corner.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/nZjqoWCsE5cQlm2FiDnAEzSBXQg.png)

Feel free to name it whatever you want, and don't worry about editing the URL. Then click "Start Editing" to make some changes!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/6yGoLU18f7rRMaHkJeUiRy3P8.png)

Now that you're in the editor you can click on anything on the webpage you want to edit, and it will open the Onlook editor.

Make some changes and once you're done, open the Extension and click the "Review" button.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QHTIOQM0nIbuEareOi2AADI.png)

This will take you to the dashboard where you will see your project and all the changes you just made. Now let's create a Pull Request.

## Creating your first Pull Request using Onlook

Let's turn your changes into code and create a Pull Request! Just click "Share" then "Pull Request"

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/JjTk1Uh2Pi2LxGYRroT0gO63mGw.png)

This will open a modal where you'll want to add Onlook to the GitHub Repository associated with your edits.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/3MWXN1W2O6LiXIzEz6NT6ewbgs.png)

GitHub will ask you to select the Repository you want to use. Make sure it's all the same Repository.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/49DBAkpxf1H2mZUp7vyCClN3L0Y.png)![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/u7faKgtv3BM1KwjkXAKSryZGE6M.png)

Once you're done, you will go back to your project where you can just click "Connect" on the Repository you setup.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/R3x6knrLl6u0wYZNqb2G5Elylgs.png)

Now just set the Branch you want to create a Pull Request from and the root directory of your code (usually this is the root folder and you can leave this alone).

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/Y68AVyFjhlnvwUzJXDTfklsYLs.png)

Don't worry, you'll only have to do this setup once for the project.

Now that it's all set you can go to the publish tab, add an optional title and description to your changes and hit the "Publish" button!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/cD94uhP16pDVHunNp6ZO6cry8OI.png)

It will load for a few seconds depending on how many changes you made. Once it completes, you'll see a link to your first Pull Request with Onlook below!

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/weAPmx3rUyDCmmdAyq0H2AVEkZY.png)

And that's it! You just created your first Pull Request with Onlook 🤘– that means real code on a real Repo.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/i17kXl5DXQ61jUB3EgaOxqVUFE.png)

If you're working with a team, ask an engineer or anyone else with GitHub access to review your Pull Request to get it merged in and keep shipping!! We really appreciate you checking out Onlook and hope this can make your workflow easier and more fun!

As always, if you have any questions or feedback let me know at kiet@onlook.dev.

## It's time for a change. Or two or three.

# What is a "Design Engineer"?

#### The hybrid species in the wilds of tech

Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone who just accidentally clicked on this link while trying to find a meme, welcome to the mysterious world of tech titles. Today, we embark on a safari into the deepest, darkest corners of the software jungle to observe a rare creature that has recently begun to make its presence known: the "Design Engineer."

Now, for those of you who thought a Design Engineer was someone who meticulously engineers the patterns on your grandma's curtains—brace yourselves. This creature is far more complex, and, dare we say, revolutionary.

## What is a Design Engineer, Really?

Imagine, if you will, a unicorn. Not the kind that prances around rainbows but a mythical creature of the tech ecosystem that embodies the elusive blend of aesthetics and functionality. This unicorn, dear readers, is a designer who decided one day that merely designing wasn't enough. They wanted to conquer the mystical lands of code too.

Enter the Design Engineer: a designer who can write frontend code and contribute to a codebase. Yes, they are the Indiana Jones of the tech world, bridging the gap between the mystical arts of design and the logical realms of engineering. They're the folks who look at a beautifully designed interface and dare to say, "Yeah, I can make that work." Or at the very least, will wrestle with [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) long enough to figure out how.

## The Rise of the Design Engineer

Over the past year, this new role has started popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. Why, you ask? Because the world of software product design is damp and moist. No wait… Because the world of software design has realized something groundbreaking. It turns out, having someone who can both envision a stunning user interface and bring it to life through code is like having your cake and eating it too—except the cake is a website, and you're eating it with your eyes. Yum!

This evolution makes sense. In the old days (circa, oh, say 2010ish or so), designers would create their visionary concepts, then drop-kick them over the proverbial fence to developers, who would then try to interpret these designs into working code. It was a bit like playing a game of telephone in a noisy bar. By the time your message gets to the other side, "Please add a button here" has turned into "The bathroom is over there."

## The Skillset of a Design Engineer

But what does it take to be this mythical creature? First off, a Design Engineer must have an eye for design—not just any eye, but the kind that can spot the difference between #FFFFFF and #FEFEFE. They must possess the artistic prowess to craft interfaces that are not only functional but also beautiful, like a Renaissance painting, but for the digital age.

On the flip side, they need to be fluent in the languages of the web—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the latest frameworks. But not just fluent. We're talking "write poetry in React" level of fluency. Mostly because engineers are very specific about their craft, and anything short of Michelangelian perfection in code is often met with a grunt of disapproval.

## Why Design Engineers Are in Demand

Companies are on the hunt for these rare beings because they speed up the development process, enhance team collaboration, and ensure that the final product actually looks like the design it was supposed to be.

A lot of times the advantage of having a Design Engineer comes through by skipping the unnecessary step of drafting pictures of a User Interface (UI) before passing it off to someone else to code. Design Engineers bring their visual fundamentals to the frontend game, not only helping a company's product and brand look good, but also saving a ton of time from idea to implementation.

But becoming a Design Engineer is no easy task, and besides the obvious fact that mashing up both an engineer and a designer into one brain is a lot to ask of a brain, the few who identify as Design Engineers tend to be special exceptions. The role is mostly occupied by art kids who played a lot of video games and got too freaky with their [Winamp skins](https://skins.webamp.org/) back in middle school and it makes sense why – you gotta have the creative side and the engineering fearlessness to learn the ins-and-outs and complexities of code.

![Examples of Winamp skins that designers have made in the past](https://framerusercontent.com/images/kahEVT5Rq0Wuv7Kw4eXb9xsp1wY.png)

## The Future of the Design Engineer

So, what does the future hold for our Design Engineer friends? Will they become the new norm, or are they just a fleeting trend, like fidget spinners or eating Tide Pods?

The truth is, as our digital world becomes increasingly visual and interactive, the demand for professionals who can seamlessly blend design with development will only grow. The Design Engineer is not just a fad; they are the pioneers of a new frontier in tech, where the lines between design and engineering blur into one holistic role.

As we wrap up our safari through the tech jungle, let's take a moment to appreciate these majestic creatures, the Design Engineers, for their unique ability to bring together the best of both worlds. They are the proof that sometimes, you really can have it all—stunning designs that work flawlessly on the web.

So, the next time you come across a beautifully designed app that works like a charm, consider that there may have been a Design Engineer involved. They're the ones making sure our digital experiences are not just functional but also delightful to behold.

And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, you're a Design Engineer in the making. If you find yourself doodling interfaces on napkins and dreaming in CSS selectors, the call of the wild might just be for you. Or you may want to try out [Onlook](https://onlook.dev/) to learn more about how you can ship code without needing to reverse the clock to an earlier stage of life to pickup odd hobbies to expedite your development into an absolute master of the frontend.

Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games—and now, Design Engineers too.

# Inline vs. Internal vs. External CSS

#### What's the difference and does it matter?

By Daniel •

2022/04/08

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CyFtPHMQ0RoMjB7Hi0hiZfyjVU.jpg)

In the wide, wild world of web design, where the brave souls who dare to venture into the abyss of code meet their fate, there lies a tale of three CSS musketeers: Inline, Internal, and External. These are not characters from a poorly written high school play, but rather, the very essence of what makes websites look less like a 1990s GeoCities page and more like the sleek, modern digital temples we worship today.

## Inline CSS: The Lone Ranger

First up, we have Inline CSS, the lone ranger of the bunch. Imagine you're getting dressed in the morning, but instead of putting on your clothes in a sensible manner, you tape each item directly to your skin. That's inline CSS. It's the practice of cramming style directly into your HTML elements, like attaching a tiny "style" suitcase to each tag as it passes by on the conveyor belt of your webpage.

Why would one do this, you ask? Well, sometimes you need that one paragraph to stand out because it's announcing something of earth-shattering importance, like the discovery that avocados have been misclassified as vegetables. In such cases, inline CSS is your quick and dirty friend. But use it sparingly, or you'll end up with a webpage that looks like it was dressed by a toddler in the dark.

## Internal CSS: The Homebody

Next, we have Internal CSS, the homebody of the group. This is when you decide to write all your styles at the top of your HTML document in a `<style>` tag. It's like keeping all your clothes in a chest at the foot of your bed. Convenient? Sure. Efficient? Debatable.

Internal CSS is great when you're making a one-page wonder or a love letter to your pet hamster, Mr. Snuffles, complete with color-coordinated sections detailing his many adventures. However, for larger sites, it's like trying to organize a wardrobe for the entire cast of "Game of Thrones" in a single closet. Chaos ensues.

## External CSS: The Social Butterfly

Lastly, we have External CSS, the social butterfly. This method involves creating a separate stylesheet file where you write all your styles, then link it to your HTML document. It's like having a personal stylist who outfits you based on the occasion; whether you're going to a black-tie event or to the grocery store, you're always appropriately dressed.

External CSS is the way to go for most websites. It keeps everything neat, organized, and easy to update. Want to change the color theme of your site from "depression chic" to "unicorn parade"? Just tweak a few lines in one file, and voilà, your site is now a beacon of joy and sparkles.

## Wrapping up

In the grand scheme of things, whether you choose Inline, Internal, or External CSS is like deciding between eating pizza with a fork and knife, scissors, or just diving in face-first. They all get the job done, but some methods are just more... refined than others.

So, as you venture forth into the tempestuous seas of web design, armed with your newfound knowledge of CSS styling, remember: the best method is the one that keeps you sane, your website looking sharp, and Mr. Snuffles' adventures in the limelight. Happy CSSing!

## It's time for a change. Or two or three.
